NOTES FROM 2/15 CLASS:
No hard requirement to do one figure, three figures, etc.
It's just an opportunity to show that you've amassed some knowledge of what we've covered so far (aside from iteration).

FOR FINAL PROJECT:
Eric's preference is to work in teams. The team results tend to be a little more creative, take a few more risks.
