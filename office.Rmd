[The Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)) (2005-2013) is one of the greatest American TV shows of all time, currently ranked #27 by IMDB users. In class we created an analysis dataset from the [**schrute**](https://bradlindblad.github.io/schrute/) package consisting of several episode-level features and the average IMDB rating. You'll take this dataset and use the [**tidymodels**](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework to train and test two models to predict the IMDB rating.
