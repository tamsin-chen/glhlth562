Run `getwd()` in the Console. Then run this chunk.

```{r getwd}
  getwd()
```

You don't get the same answer because knitting a Rmd is a self-contained action that sets the working directory to the location of the Rmd file.

The `ducks.csv` file is located in `wrangling1/data/ducks.csv`. Based on the working directory, R will find `read_csv("data/ducks.csv")` if you run it in the Console. But it will fail when you knit this document. Try it.

```{r duck1, eval=TRUE}
  read_csv("data/ducks.csv")
```

**After trying (and failing to knit), replace `eval=TRUE` with `eval=FALSE` so we can move on without this error.**

You could replace this with `read_csv("../data/ducks.csv")` and it will work when you knit or run the chunk, but it will fail in the Console. Try it. Paste `read_csv("../data/ducks.csv")` in the Console.

```{r duck2}
  read_csv("../data/ducks.csv")
```

A fix that works for the Console and knitr is to use the `here()` function from the `{here}` package to use paths relative to the project working directory.

```{r duck3}
  read_csv(here::here("data", "ducks.csv"))
```
