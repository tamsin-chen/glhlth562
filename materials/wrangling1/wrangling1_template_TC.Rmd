## What the duck?

What happens when you run this chunk? Spoiler: it won't work. How can you fix it?

```{r duck}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/duck.png")
```

## Move the duck and find it again

* Copy the image `duck.png`, rename it `mallard.png`, and move `mallard.png` up a level to the `materials` folder (a simple way to do this in one step is `More Gear > Copy To...`)
* The `mallard` chunk should fail
* `../` tells R to look up one level; `../../` says "go up two levels
* Help R find `materials/mallard.png`

```{r mallard}
  knitr::include_graphics("../mallard.png")
```

## Just when you think you understand

* Knitting a Rmarkdown file is a special action: when a document is knit, the working directory for the knitting process is the directory where the Rmd file lives, not the project root
* Open the `analysis/duck.Rmd` file to see this

# Importing data, local

## csv

```{r}
  df_csv <- read_csv(here::here("data", "confirmed_global.csv"))
  spec(df_csv) # tells you what type of data each column is
```

### Custom specifications

```{r}
# import `1/22/20` as an integer
  df_csv <- read_csv(here::here("data", "confirmed_global.csv"),
                     col_types = list(
                       `1/22/20` = col_integer())) # import as integer
  spec(df_csv)
```

### Always inspect your data after import

```{r}
  lots <- read_csv(here::here("data", "lots.csv"))
  
  lots %>% 
    summarise(mean_dens = mean(Density_sqkm))
```

What's going on?

```{r}
  lots
```

### Ignoring NAs doesn't work because the class is character

```{r}
  #?mean
  lots %>% summarise(mean_dens = mean(Density_sqkm, na.rm=TRUE))
```

### "There are a lot of ducks" needs to be missing

```{r}
  lots %>% 
    mutate(Density_sqkm = case_when(
             Density_sqkm == "there are a lot of ducks" ~ NA_character_,
             TRUE ~ Density_sqkm), # if it's anything other than "there are a lot of ducks," keep it as is
           Density_sqkm = as.numeric(Density_sqkm)) %>%
    summarise(mean_dens = mean(Density_sqkm, na.rm=TRUE))
```

## Rdata

You can save a snapshot of a whole bunch of objects as a single .RData file, which you can then load into RStudio. E.g., if you want to save someone a bunch of processing time.
```{r}
  save(lots, file = here::here("data", "example.RData"))
  load("data/confirmed_global.RData")
```

## Excel

```{r}
  df_xls <- readxl::read_excel(here::here("data", "confirmed_global.xlsx"),
                               sheet="myData")
```

## Stata, SAS, SPSS

```{r}
  library(haven)
  df_dta <- read_dta(here::here("data", "confirmed_global.dta"))
  df_spss <- read_sav(here::here("data", "confirmed_global.sav"))
  df_sas <- read_sas(here::here("data", "confirmed_global.sas7bdat"))
```

# Importing data, web

## csv

```{r}
  myUrl <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv"

  df_url <- read_csv(myUrl)
```

## Google Sheets

The `{googlesheets4}` package, also a member of the `tidyverse`, lets you read and write from/to Google Sheets. Running `sheets_deauth()` after loading the package will turn off authentication so you can read publicly shared sheets without having to login.

You don't have to use the deauth() function if the Google Sheet is publicly shared (share settings is "Anyone on the Internet can view").

```{r}
  library(googlesheets4)
  gs4_deauth() # turns off authentication to read publicly shared sheets without login

  gsURL <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ibAj_plJBjumAvr8P8_TzwWaU8gTciOeuTwVjN4cZIM/edit?usp=sharing"
  
  df_gs <- read_sheet(gsURL)
```

## APIs

Unlike other packages, R can read in data from an API.

```{r}
# https://fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2021/01/31/getting-data-from-canada-covid-19-tracker-using-r/

  library(httr)
  library(jsonlite)
  #library(tidyverse) # we've already loaded

# build request 
  base  <- "https://api.covid19tracker.ca"
  ep    <- "/reports/province/sk"
  query <- "?date=2021-01-31"
  req   <- paste0(base, ep, query)
  req
  
# make the request
  response <- GET(req)
  response # status 200 signals success
  
# look at information received
  jsonlite::prettify(content(response, 'text', encoding = 'UTF-8'))
  
# run a complete example
  base <- 'https://api.covid19tracker.ca'
  ep <- '/reports/province/sk'
  req <- paste0(base, ep)
  response <- GET(req)
  cases <- response %>%
    content(as = 'text', encoding = 'UTF-8') %>%
    fromJSON() %>%
    pluck('data') %>%
    as_tibble()
  cases
  
# plot
  cases %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = change_cases)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(x = NULL, y = 'Cases',
         title = 'Daily Covid-19 cases in Saskatchewan',
         caption = 'Source: N. Little. COVID-19 Tracker Canada (2021), COVID19tracker.ca')
```
## datapasta

```{r}
# install

  library(datapasta)

# Copy Brisbane weather table

# Set the keyboard shortcuts 
#  Tools -> Addins -> Browse Addins, then click Keyboard Shortcuts...
#  Look for tribble_paste
#  Use Recommend Ctrl + Shift + t as shortcut
