# `ggplot2` API
 
We'll use this plot from the [Financial Times](https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-chart/) to explore the `ggplot2` API:

```{r inspiration, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="New deaths attributed to Covid-19, Financial Times."}
  knitr::include_graphics(here::here("materials", "dataviz1", "img", "ft2.png"))
```

Data are rarely ready to plot right out of the box like this. We'll skip the import and wrangling details for now, but take note (right) of what's required in this case.

```{r coviddata, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# eval=FALSE means that this chunk will not run
# we'll skip these steps and import the wrangled data instead

  pop <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv") %>%
  # keep only the columns we need
    select(Province_State, Population) %>%
  # keep only the rows we need
    filter(Province_State=="North Carolina" | Province_State=="Arizona") %>%
  # aggregate population
    group_by(Province_State) %>%
    summarize(Population = sum(Population)) 

  covid <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv") %>%
  # keep only the columns we need
    select(Province_State, Population, contains("/")) %>%
  # keep only the rows we need
    filter(Province_State=="North Carolina" | Province_State=="Arizona") %>%
  # make long
    pivot_longer(cols = c(-Province_State, -Population),
                 names_to = "date",
                 values_to = "totalDeaths") %>%
  # convert date to proper date
    mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>%
  # aggregate by state and date
    group_by(Province_State, date) %>%
    summarize(totalDeaths = sum(totalDeaths)) %>%
  # calculate daily deaths
  # end up with some negative values, likely due to data revisions
    group_by(Province_State) %>%
    mutate(dailyDeaths = c(totalDeaths[1], diff(totalDeaths))) %>%
  # make sure series is complete
    ungroup() %>%
    complete(Province_State, date, fill = list(0)) %>%
  # keep only dates in range
    filter(date >= "2020-08-20" & date <= "2021-07-12") %>%
  # calculate rolling mean
    group_by(Province_State) %>%
    mutate(deaths_roll7 = zoo::rollmean(dailyDeaths, k = 7, fill = NA)) %>%
    filter(!is.na(deaths_roll7)) %>%
    filter(date >= "2020-09-01") %>%
  # merge in pop data and normalize
    left_join(pop, by="Province_State") %>%
    mutate(deaths_roll7_100k = (deaths_roll7/Population)*100000) %>%
  # label the last entry for each state (for the plotting step)
    mutate(label = if_else(date == max(date), 
                           Province_State, 
                           NA_character_)) %>%
    select(Province_State, date, deaths_roll7, deaths_roll7_100k, label)
```

# Load the data

The processed and ready to plot data are stored in the `covid.csv` file. Let's load it.

```{r load}
  covid <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericpgreen/glhlth562/main/materials/dataviz1/covid.csv")
# or
# read_csv(here::here("materials", "dataviz1", "covid.csv"))
  glimpse(covid)
```

# Create a canvas

`ggplot()` tells R that we want to plot something, but we haven't specified any data or told R how the data map to this plot canvas.

```{r canvas}
  ggplot()
```

# Map data to the canvas

The first step is to tell `ggplot()` what data you want to plot and specify how the data maps onto the canvas. Which variable maps to the `x` axis? To the `y` axis?

```{r mapping}
# ggplot(data = covid, mapping = aes(x = date, y = deaths_roll7_100k))
# most of the time you'll see the data and mapping argument names omitted
  ggplot(covid, aes(x = date, y = deaths_roll7_100k))
```

# Add a `geom_`

Our plot has appropriate axes now that we've mapped the data, but the canvas is blank because we've not told R how to represent the data. Our inspiration plot uses lines, so we will too.

```{r geom}
  ggplot(covid, aes(x = date, y = deaths_roll7_100k)) +
    geom_line()
```

This does not look right because we did not tell R that the data are grouped. `covid` is a 'long' dataset with two series:: Arizona and North Carolina. Which variable contains this grouping information?

```{r grouping}
  ggplot(covid, aes(x = date, 
                    y = deaths_roll7_100k,
                    group = Province_State)) +
    geom_line()
```

We need to add color to identify each state's line. One point of friction for new users is deciding whether to use `color` or `fill`. Remember this: Lines and points use `color`. Rather than specifying `group` explicitly, we can simplify to `color`, which implicitly tells R that we're coloring by group.

```{r addColor}
  ggplot(covid, aes(x = date, 
                    y = deaths_roll7_100k,
                    color = Province_State)) +
    geom_line()
```

# Modify the look

We'll dig into plot refinements after the break. For now, just take note of the layering approach.

```{r changeColors}
  ggplot(covid,                                     # data
         aes(x = date,                              # mapping
             y = deaths_roll7_100k,       
             color = Province_State)) +
         geom_line() +                              # geom
         scale_color_manual(values = c(             # theme
                                       "#eb5e8d",     # pink 
                                       "#0f5599"      # blue
                                       )) +
        ft_theme()    
```
