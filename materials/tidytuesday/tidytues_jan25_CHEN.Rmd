# Exploration

## Data prep

```{r understand data, eval = FALSE}

# check which column(s) uniquely identify the ratings and details data frames
isid(ratings, vars = c("id")) # TRUE
isid(ratings, vars = c("num")) # TRUE
isid(details, vars = c("id")) # TRUE
isid(details, vars = c("num")) # TRUE
```

```{r data prep}
# the details data frame is a subset of the ratings data frame; there are 200 more board games in ratings with no corresponding row in details.

# merge the ratings and details data frames on id, returning all rows from ratings where there are matches in details, and all columns from both data frames
ratingsdetails <- inner_join(ratings, details, by = "id") %>%
  filter(bayes_average > 0) %>%
  select(id, name, rank, average, bayes_average, users_rated, thumbnail, owned) # select columns I'm interested in
```

## Explore data

I hypothesize a positive correlation between rating and ownership. I will use the Bayesian average rating instead of the popular average rating because I like how it does not allow ratings with few users_rated to skew the data. Here's a quick scatter plot of rating by ownership to see if anything interesting jumps out at me.

```{r exploratory scatter plot}
ggplot(ratingsdetails, aes(x=bayes_average, y=owned)) +
  geom_point()
```

Three games stand out as being both quite highly rated and enormously popular (high ownership):

* Pandemic: id = 30549, bayes_average = 7.487, owned = 168,364
* Carcassonne: id = 822, bayes_average = 7.309, owned = 161,299
* Catan: id = 13, bayes_average = 6.970, owned = 167,733


A few games stand out as being more popular than their rating would suggest:

* Monopoly: id = 1406, bayes_average = 4.304, owned = 43,316
* Cards Against Humanity: id = 50381, bayes_average = 5.692, owned = 42,450
* Munchkin: id = 1927, bayes_average = 5.717, owned = 78,849
* UNO: id = 2223, bayes_average = 5.313, owned = 43,200
* Risk: id = 181, bayes_average = 5.462, owned = 50,362


A few games stand out as being adored by the few who own them:

* Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition: id = 233078, bayes_average = 8.262, owned = 20,542
* Gaia Project: id = 220308, bayes_average = 8.175, owned = 24,230

## Notes

### Simple and effective choice of geoms

I like cooperative games quite a bit. Like Vogg, I was also curious about how the share of cooperative games has changed over time. I don't remember playing any as a kid in the '90s, so I was curious to see how popular cooperative games were in the early 2000s.

* I thought Vogg was right to focus on the rising _proportion_ of games that are cooperative, not just rising number of cooperative games. The geom_area() plot was a smart way to illustrate this. Also, it allowed readers to see that the large majority of games are still non-cooperative.
* Vogg used geom_texthline() to illustrate the 20% threshold to good effect.
* His faceted column plot was also very easy to understand. As a stylistic choice, Vogg used geom_chicklet() from the ggchicklet package instead of the regular geom_col() to make the columns have rounded edges (I guess because of Chicklet candies?).

### Elegant and efficient data wrangling

* Last Tidy Tuesday, I experimented wtih grepl(). I learned from Vogg that there is also str_detect(). According to [this stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57412700/whats-the-difference-between-the-str-detect-function-in-stringer-and-grepl-and/57413821), there may be reasons to prefer str_detect() over grepl(), including speed.
* I was really impressed by how few lines of code Vogg used to create coop_df, and in particular, how he created columns for counts and proportions using 'n' and 'nn'.
* I learned how to use mutate() with cut(), breaks(), and labels() to create a new column for binning data. Very neat that that took Vogg just three lines of code.
